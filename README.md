### Installation

No additional installation is required for this project

## Development

### Part 1: Google Maps API and Foursquare API
* Generate a unique key from [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/) and create `index.html`.
* Set the center and zoom accordingly
* Sign up on `foursquare.com`, create a new app which which provide `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` for that app. These unique ID's will be used for fetching data from `foursquare.com` using `AJAX`

### Part 2: Include jQuery and Knockout Javascript
* Use the above mentioned links and append them in `index.html`

### Part 3: Include CSS file, Bootstrap library and Google Fonts
* Create a `style.css` file in `css folder` with all required styling and link it to `index.html`
* Use the above mentioned link for `Bootstrap` and link it in `index.html`
* Use the above mentioned link for `Google Fonts` and link it in `index.html` and `style.css`

### Part 4: Creating and coding functionalities in app.js and init.js
* Create `initMap` and `navToggle` functions in `init.js`

* Now in `app.js`, create an object of eating joints with their name, coordinates and unique Id generated from [foursquare.com]. Create `Viewmodel` with functions to:
  > Create Markers <br>
    Fetch information for Markers from [foursquare.com] using `AJAX` request <br>
    Create Infowindows with relevent information <br>
    Display information fetched from [Foursquare API Explorer] on clicking them <br>
    Style Markers <br>
    Show selected Marker <br>
    Bind data for `Search Bar` using `Knockout Javascript` <br>
    Show and Hide Markers <br>
    Create, toggle and add features to `Drawing Toolbar` <br>

For details now how these functionalities have been implemented, refer the source code. 

**App is completed! Have fun exploring delicious places!**
